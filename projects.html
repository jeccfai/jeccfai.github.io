                <strong>Skin Lesion Analysis</strong><br>
            </div>
            <div>
                This project is the final year project I am currently carrying out for my 
                penultimate year of university. The project is research based and is 
                about the computational analysis of pigmented skin lesions such as skin 
                cancers (e.g. melanoma, non-melanoma) using Computer Vision. My motive 
                in this project is to compare deep learning methods to traditional methods.

                <strong>Artificial Neural Network</strong><br>
            </div>
            <div>
                In my 2nd year of university, one of coursework tasks was to develop an 
                Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the error backpropogation algorithm. 
                This ANN was used to predict the pan evaporation given predictors such as 
                temperature, wind speed, humidity and more. The project included pre-processing
                of the data in which I used Weka to do so. Randomising, splitting and normalising
                my data before passing it into the ANN.

                During the summer of 2020, I was asked to help build a website for a start-up 
                company. Given the functionality the client wanted and only me working on it, I 
                decided to use WordPress as it offers easy management with a lot of possible
                plugins to choose from. I was able to expand my knowledge of WordPress from 
                my 2nd year of university to which I also improved my CSS skills.

            <div>
                During the 2nd year of university, the entire course was split into teams and
                given the task to develop a helpdesk webiste. This module was split over two 
                semesters, the first was to develop with a team of your choice, a helpdesk 
                website from scratch. For this semester, our team made use of HTML, CSS, 
                PHP Laravel, phpMyAdmin, SQL and tools such as Slack to assist us in communication.
                I was involved in the design of wireframes and putting together a design report
                for the website. I also had a hand in developing using PHP Laravel which was
                a new experience for me.
                <br><br>
                The second semester involved a similar task however the teams were randomised 
                and we had to develop the website using a CMS of the choices, WordPress, Joomla or
                Drupal. This part of the module I was in charge of implementing and designing the
                website, finding plugins I required along the way. I also lead the demonstration of
                this website, taking on any questions when asked. This semester, our team used 
                WhatsApp for communication and Trello to keep on track.

            <div>
                This project involved developing an Android mobile application of our choice 
                as long as the idea possible in the timeframe given. I chose to develop a 
                recipe taking application as losing a recipe I have previously used is a 
                problem I face. I used Java in Android Studio and used Firebase Storage and 
                database.
